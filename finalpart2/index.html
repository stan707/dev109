    <h1>Final Part 2: Portfolio Reflection</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I only knew some html elements.</li>
            <li>For CSS, I only knew that it has to do with styling, such as changing colors and fonts. </li>
            <li>I had very little knowledge of JavaScript. Everything I learned about javascript was new to me. </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I built my portfolio from scratch. Using a template would of helped but I think I was able to do a good job without one. </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (i.e., the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The most challenging part was CSS. I spent the most time with CSS especially when it came to positioning and making the layout responsive.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>This class helped me understand what it takes to create the webpages that we use in everyday lives. Theres a lot of complexity and creativity involved behind the scenes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a solid foundation of HTML and CSS before diving into JavaScript, as it will make learning more advanced concepts easier.</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to experiment and break things. It's all part of the learning process, and debugging is a key skill in web development.</li>      
            <li>Take your time with each project. Don't rush things and try to finish them in 1 day.</li>
        </ul>
